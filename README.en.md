# Sonic Topography

[中文](./README.md) | English

Sonic Topography is a desktop music player and 3D music visualizer. It turns low, mid, and high frequency energy into a glowing, moving terrain so music feels like a living sound map.

## Highlights

- Desktop app: built with Electron, so it runs as its own window instead of a browser tab.
- 3D music terrain: frequency bands drive terrain columns, glow, ripples, meteors, and lyrics.
- Local playback: upload local audio files and optional `.lrc` lyric files.
- Built-in demo: open the app and preview the visualizer without preparing music first.
- Netease Cloud Music: open the official login window in the desktop app, scan the QR code, and use the local Cookie for search, playlists, daily recommendations, and playback.
- QQ Music: open the official login window in the desktop app, scan the QR code, and use the QQ Music Cookie for search, playback, and lyrics.
- Local playlists: save favorite tracks into local playlists.
- More human-friendly Ground EQ: use 8 frequency faders to control how different sounds shape the terrain.
- Time display and Pomodoro: turn the visualizer into a focus-friendly desktop clock and timer.
- Preset transfer: import and export playlists, effects, Ground EQ, custom themes, and browser settings.

## Quick Start

If you only want to use the app:

1. Download and install the Windows installer.
2. Open `Sonic Topography`.
3. Click `AJIN.` in the top-left corner to open the side rail.
4. Click `Demo` first to check that visuals and audio are working.
5. Click `Upload` to play your own local audio file.
6. To use Netease or QQ Music, open `Settings -> Account`, then follow the official QR login flow.

## Interface

Click `AJIN.` in the top-left corner to open the side rail.

- `Visual`: close panels and return to the 3D music terrain.
- `Settings`: open visualizer, Ground EQ, theme, account login, and display settings.
- `Search`: search Netease Cloud Music and QQ Music.
- `Netease`: appears after a valid Netease Cookie is saved; opens liked songs, playlists, and daily recommendations.
- `Playlist`: open local playlists.
- `Demo`: play the built-in demo.
- `Upload`: choose local audio or `.lrc` lyric files.
- `Fullscreen`: enter or exit fullscreen.

## Ground EQ

Ground EQ controls how different parts of the music affect the 3D terrain. It is not a traditional audio equalizer that only changes the sound; it is a visual effects mixer for the ground.

Each fader has a visual personality:

- `SUB BASS / Center Lift`: lets deep bass push the center of the terrain.
- `BASS / Weight`: controls the heavy body of the low end.
- `LOW MID / Slow Flow`: creates slower terrain waves.
- `MID / Direction Flow`: adds directional movement from mid frequencies.
- `HIGH MID / Peaks`: makes rhythmic highlights rise into sharper peaks.
- `PRESENCE / Flash Trigger`: controls local flashes and bright accents.
- `BRILLIANCE / Edge Shimmer`: adds small, light edge sparkles.
- `AIR / Air Particles`: controls the lightest high-frequency particles.

The `Motion Speed` slider controls how quickly the ground rises and falls. Higher values feel more responsive; lower values feel smoother and calmer.

## Time Display And Pomodoro

Sonic Topography can also work as a focus desktop background. When time display is enabled, a large clock appears over the 3D terrain. With Pomodoro mode, it can support work, study, reading, or breaks.

Suggested use:

1. Play focus music or ambient sound.
2. Enable the time display.
3. Start a Pomodoro session at your own pace.
4. Enter fullscreen and let it become a lightweight focus desktop.

## Account Login

Open `Settings -> Account`, then choose `Netease` or `QQ Music`.

In the Electron desktop app, click `Open Official QR Login` to open the official login page. After QR login succeeds, Sonic Topography reads the Cookie from that login window and syncs it to the local proxy service.

In a normal browser dev page, QR login is unavailable. Manual Cookie inputs remain only as a fallback debug path.

Cookies are sensitive login credentials and are stored only on your machine. Do not export, upload, or share them.

## Preset Import And Export

Settings can import or export presets. Presets are useful when moving your visual setup between machines.

Preset files can include:

- Playlists
- Pulse effects
- Meteor effects
- Ground EQ
- Custom themes
- Browser settings

Export can optionally include Cookies. In most cases, do not include Cookies unless you understand the risk and are only moving data between your own devices.

## Local Data

- Themes, effects, Ground EQ, account Cookies, and most settings are stored locally on your machine.
- During source development, local playlists are saved through `/api/playlists` into `data/playlists.json`.
- In packaged Electron, local server data is stored under Electron's user data directory.
- Uploaded audio files are not exported in preset files and are not bundled into the installer.

## Development

Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

Use Electron mode for day-to-day development:

```powershell
npm run dev:electron
```

This starts the Vite dev server and opens an Electron window. Edits under `src/`, CSS, React components, and Settings UI usually hot-update.

Browser-only UI development is also available:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Restart Electron after changing:

- `desktop/main.js`
- `desktop/preload.cjs`
- Electron packaging config, window behavior, or IPC login bridges
- Local server and proxy code

## Packaging

Before release:

```powershell
npm run build:electron
```

The Windows installer is written to:

```text
release/
```

For a packaged directory without creating an installer:

```powershell
npm run build:electron:dir
```

## Useful Commands

```powershell
npm run dev:electron
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run build:electron:dir
npm run build:electron
```

## Notes

- Netease and QQ Music playback may be affected by copyright, membership, region, or account state.
- Search results only show content available under the current anonymous state or current Cookie permissions.
- Do not commit `dist/`, `release/`, local `data/`, update downloads, or account Cookies.
- If a song appears in search but cannot play, check account state, song copyright, and whether the selected quality is available.

## Buy The Author A Coffee

If you enjoy Sonic Topography, or if it happens to keep you company during work, study, or creative time, you can buy the author a coffee.

All support will be used to buy tokens and related services so the app can keep improving, fixing bugs, adding features, and becoming nicer to use.

Thank you for every bit of support. This project will keep growing.
